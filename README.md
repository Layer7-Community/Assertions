# Connectors
This repository is for connectors to third party solution for use by the Layer7 API Gateway. Examples of connectors may include cloud solutions or other common 3rd party solutions deployed on-premise.

## Here is a list of available connectors

|Name|Brief Description|
|-----|-----------------|
|sample|This is a sample of how each connector should be structured in the repository and should be used as a guideline for all contributions|


## Using the Demo

Each connector has its own structure and its own description. After downloading or cloning this project simply change into
 the directory of your target connector folder and follow its instructions.

## Feedback
We are certainly happy about any feedback on these tutorials, especially if they helped you in your daily work life! We 
are also available via the [Layer7 Communities](https://community.broadcom.com/enterprisesoftware/communities/communityhomeblogs?CommunityKey=0f580f5f-30a4-41de-a75c-e5f433325a18)

## IMPORTANT
If any connector has an issue, please do not contact Broadcom support. These connectors are provided as-is. Please communicate via comments, pull requests and emails to the author of the demo if you have any issues or questions.

## Contribution Guidelines
To contribute connectors, create a pull request with your updates. All pull requests require at least one reviewer to approve before the contribution will be merged to the main branch. Please ensure that all contributions follow the structure of the "sample" folder.
Each new connector should:
- Be located in it's own folder
- Include a description in the README.md file in the folder with a description of the connector along with instructions on how to use the connector including any prerequisites
- Update the README.md on the main folder to add a name and brief description of the connector

**Enjoy!**
